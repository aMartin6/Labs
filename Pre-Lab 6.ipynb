    "* **Recursion** is a method of probelm solving where a problem is broken down into small enough pieces that they become trivial. These often involve functions calling themselves.\n",
    "* A simple example is using for loops to calculate sums.\n",
    "* We can do this without using a for loop by adding two numbers in a list together at a time.\n",
    "    * This can be done using a function that calls itself as long as the length of the list is not equal to 1. \n",
    "* When a function calls itself, its called a **recursive call.** It continues calling itself until the calcualtion can no longer be broken down, and then it peices itself back together. \n",
    "* The three laws of recursion are:\n",
    "    * The algorithm must have a base case.\n",
    "    * The algirithm must change its state and move toward the base case.\n",
    "    * The algirithm must call itself recursively.\n",
    "* This method can be used to convert integers into strings. We need a convert string to do this. \n",
    "    * The base case will be when the integer is a single digit. \n",
    "    * The change of state will be integer division, where the remainder is stored.\n",
    "* We can convert an integer to binary if we use base 2 for integer division.\n",
    "* We can use recursion to create fractals. This can be visualized using the turtle program.\n",
    "    * For fractals the base case is chosen arbitrarily, because in theory, fractals go on forever. "
