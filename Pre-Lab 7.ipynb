    "* The **LU decompostition** is a method that performs a transform on matrix **A**, and this same trasform can be used on multiple vectors **v** witout having to re-calcuate A.\n",
    "* Matrix operations can be recorded in the form of a metrix, **L**0 that when multiplied by the origional matrix gives us the trasformed matrix. \n",
    "    * This matrix will always be lower triangular\n",
    "* **L**1 - **L**3 represent the rest of the rest of the matrix operations.\n",
    "* If we multilpy both sides by all of these operations, we get **L**3**L**2**L**1**L**0**Ax** = **L**3**L**2**L**1**L**0**v**. This puts the matrix into upper trianguar form.\n",
    "* Usint this method, we only need to calcualte **L**3**L**2**L**1**L**0**A** once.\n",
    "* To use this in code, define the marticies: **L** = **L**0^-1**L**1^-1**L**2^-1**L**3^-1 and **U** = **L**3**L**2**L**1**L**0**A**. That way **LU** = **A** and **LUx** = **v**.\n",

    "* It is important to incorporate pivoting.\n",
    "* The python functions for solving systems of equations are in _numpy.lintag_. The function _solve_ solved linear systems of equations."
