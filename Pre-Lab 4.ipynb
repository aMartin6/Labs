    "* The main source of error for integration in Python is **approximation error**.\n",
    "* To find this error, we can create a taylor series for each slice, and add them together. The first term in the taylor series is what is calculated using the trapezoidal rule, and the rest are equal to the error.\n",
    "    * The error is denoted O(h^n) where the series is truncated after the nth term\n",
    "* Through cancelling out terms in the taylor exapansion, we can rearange the error formula into the Euler Maclauren formula.\n",
    "* The first term in the **Euler-Maclauren formula** is epsilon = (1/12) * h^2 * [f'(a) - f'(b)]. The rest of the terms represent the rest of the even orders of h: h^4, H^6, ...\n",
    "    * Usually if h is small, its pretty accurate to neglect the h^4 and higher terms.\n",
    "* The rounding error is about C times the value of the integral, where the approximation constant C = 10^(-16) approximately.\n",
    "* The integration reaches _macheine precision_ when N = 10^8 approximately. This means that the rounding error becomes bigger than the approximation error, so there is no need to have a larger N.\n",
    "* For Simpson's rule epsilon = (1/90) * h^4 * [f'''(a) - f'''(b)]. \n",
    "* Using Simpson's rule, the integration reaches macheine precision around N = 10000.\n",
    "* Simpson's rule noramlly give us a better approximation, but not always."
